        "This work aims to develop a system capable of quickly determining the level of accessibility of a given sidewalk. This system would assist visually impaired individuals with navigating densely obstructed walkways common in major cities and allow for autonomous navigation of dynamically shifting sidewalk environments. We utilize the Cityscapes Dataset, a collection of 5k images taken from the dashcam of a car around 50 European cities. Each image is associated with a fine, instanced annotation of 30 classes. We subsampled this dataset to approximately 3k images containing a portion of the visible, segmented sidewalk. We utilized multiple models capable of segmenting these images into component objects, planning further to process the location and identity of the objects to determine the degree of obstruction present in the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "We explored multiple methodologies to obtain segmentations; MaskRCNN, UNet, SAM (Segment Anything Model), and YOLO, with Random Forest operating as a baseline. The MaskRCNN model was the best choice, as it can produce instanced segmentations while determining the class of the segmented object. The MaskRCNN model is built on FPN and ResNet101 and is pre-trained on the MS COCO dataset, producing instanced segmentations for everyday objects. By adding some additional dense layers for classification, we attempted to train the model to utilize the segmentations to predict observed obstruction of the sidewalk."

        "\n",
        "The inspiration for this work is Project Sidewalk from The University of Washington. The University of Washington project aims to collect a dataset containing all locations and timestamps for sidewalk obstructions and accessibility items. They plan to utilize this data for machine learning, but their public APIs only provide access to the location information of identified obstacles and objects. We plan to expand upon this idea and create a system capable of automatically determining obstructions present on a sidewalk from simple images or video frames.\n",
        "\n",
        "To simplify our research, we identified three tasks we must address. The first step was obtaining a segmented sidewalk region within an image. The second was to obtain segmentations of objects which would compose common sidewalk obstructions. The final step was to, utilizing the location and object type, determine the likelihood of each object constituting a suitable obstruction. We utilized Random Forest to obtain sidewalk segmentations from the input image to compare our model to a baseline prediction. We did not compose baseline predictions for total obstruction classification, as this problem is rather complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first segmentation task was relatively easy, as obtaining semantic sidewalk through the use of pre-trained, as well as custom models, was largely successful. We obtained acceptable performance on a simple sidewalk segmentation task utilizing a custom-trained U-Net.  When compared to our baseline prediction, this implementation was incredibly successful. Random forest obtained a Dice score of 0.077, while the U-Net obtained a Dice score of .72 on the same validation dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second segmentation task was slightly more challenging than the initial. We required segmentations for each object in the image that could constitute a sidewalk obstruction. For each object to be processed individually, more than semantic segmentations is required. Instead, we would need to produce instanced segmentations. To accomplish this task, we explored utilizing multiple pre-trained models; MaskRCNN, Yolo, and SAM. Each model successfully obtained the required instanced segmentation from a minimally processed image; however, there were significant compatibility issues with utilizing each one. After significant tinkering, MaskRCNN was the best model to move forward within our specific development environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the obstruction classification was the most challenging aspect of this work. Utilizing the instanced segmentation model, we needed to append additional layers to determine the level of obstruction for each segmented object. To accomplish this, we added dense layers parallel to the class and bounding box determination layers, comparing obstruction prediction to an algorithmically determined ground truth obtained from an augmented dataset."

This dataset is extensive, however we only needed a subset of data for our purposes, notably images containing sidewalks.  After isolating and processing the data, we were left with slightly over 3k samples. Each sample included an image, a semantic segmentation mask for each object class, and a json file detailing polygon coordinates and class for each occurence of an object within the image (instanced segmentaiton).  After extraction, we applied a custom train/test/val split, allocating 10% of the data for both validation and testing, with the remaining 80% utilized for training.\n",
