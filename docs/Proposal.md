# Project Sidewalk: Proposal 
***
## Motivation
Accessibility remains a big challenge to pedestrians in rural and urban areas alike. We want to examine how accessible the sidewalks in major US cities are for people with disabilities. Motivated by University of Washington's crowdsourcing effort [Project Sidewalk](https://sidewalk-sea.cs.washington.edu/), we aim to first detect the existence of sidewalks by segmenting the pavement from other objects in an image. Next we determine the state of how accessible to sidewalk is - this is done by detecting the features of the sidewalk that might not be accessible. 


## Method
This project will explore the application of existing convolution network architectures for object detection and segmentation of images.

We will be using datasets from [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) and [Project Sidewalk](https://sidewalk-sea.cs.washington.edu/api#access-api-header). 

### Dataset description
* **Cityscapes**
* **Project Sidewalk**

## Experiment
*What experiments are you planning to run? How do you plan to evaluate your machine learning algorithm?*

We will fine-tune existing architecture to perform our task.
